# Hello World!
Hello World! This is my first time that I use github since then.<br />
I plan to upload all my projects from 2016 (just for fun).<br />
Have a nice day, everybody!<br />
## roskinetic_hector_slam/real_maps<br /> 
- Some real maps from my parents'clinics - the corridor part (clinicCorridor.pgm) and my Nana's house (nanaHouse.pgm).<br />
- This is a fork of the original code from tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_slam, with some changes.<br />
- ROS Kinetic (2016) - Portable device - RPLIDAR A1M8.
